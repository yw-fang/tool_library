## Repo introduction

### Why I set up this repo:

In the past five years, I have written a lot of short script using fortran, python, and linux shell with the combination of awk and sed. However, I have never kept them well. Each time I have to write again for a same task because I cannot find the one I used before.

In this week, motivated by Togo sensei in our group, I decided to well organise my sripts so that I can make better use of the time.

All the scripts shown in this repo are all written by myself. Any one
