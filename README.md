## About this repo. 

### Why I set up this repo.:

In the past five years when I was studying in Shanghai, I have written a lot of short scripts using fortran, python, and linux shell with the combination of awk and sed. They are usually very short, but in the mean time they are quite helpful for some specific jobs especially for those which needs to be done automatically. However, I have never kept those scripts well. Each time when I need any script, I have to write again even for a same task because I cannot find the one I used before.

In this week, motivated by Togo-sensei in our group, I decided to well organise my sripts so that I can make better use of the time.

All the scripts shown in this repo. are all written by myself. Any one who is interested in any script in this repo. can use and modify it under Mozilla license.
